# RealLifeCompSci
For now, just a text file where I write down crazy ideas that I have about implementing theories and stuff from Computer Science in real life. Look at the readme if you're confused.

A LOT (if not all) of these will be barely more than a "what-if" that crosses my mind at some point during the day. So please don't make fun of me if it's a stupid idea ;-;

## Thought 1
Implementing a cities layout using a Tree data structure (with weighted branches). Alright, so a specifically shaped graph that looks like a tree. Would this lead to O(logn) travel performance? Investigate / research into the data structures further.

##Thought 2
Having subgraphs in each node of a graph. This came about as I was thinking about graph theory for dependency graphs.
tldr; each macro node is a node for a certain program (feh, libreoffice, vim, etc) and is made up of micro-nodes (versions of the programs)
	ex) the feh macro-node is comprised of a micro graph of versions 1.07 - 2.3.1

Not sure how helpful this would actually be though
Will have to look into it more later.
